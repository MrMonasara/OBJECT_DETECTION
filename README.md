Image Cropping Model

Project Overview

This project implements an image cropping model using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, designed to automate the cropping of images by removing 
predefined header and footer sections. The model is trained on a dataset of images and can be used to predict cropping dimensions for new images. 
The primary application is intended for Instagram images, focusing on enhancing image presentation by removing unnecessary header or footer elements.

Features

Automatic Image Cropping: Automatically crops images based on learned header and footer dimensions.
PyTorch Lightning: Utilizes PyTorch Lightning to simplify the training pipeline, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
Google Colab Integration: Ready to run in Google Colab with Google Drive integration for easy access to datasets and storage of output.

Installation

pip install torch torchvision pytorch_lightning Pillow
